# Skeleton

This is a simple demo that can be used to bootstrap your RhIO application
writing.

This demo will link against RhIO and expose variables which are time (`test/t`),
amplitude (`test/aplitude`) and a sine wave (`test/s`).

For more information, read the [Getting started](../Docs/getting_started.md)
documentation.
