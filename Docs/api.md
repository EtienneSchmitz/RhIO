# RhIO API

RhIO will automatically run a server on startup when it is linked into your app,
you don't have to do it manually (it uses compiler constructors).

You'll first have to include the ``RhIO.hpp`` file:

`̀``cpp
#include <RhIO.hpp>
```

Then, you can access the root node of RhIO using ``RhIO::Root`̀`. There is several 
examples in the `Examples/` directory of this repository.
